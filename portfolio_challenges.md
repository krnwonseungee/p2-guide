## Portfolio Challenges

Portfolio challenges are provided for you optimize your learning. You should
complete these solo and make sure you meet all the learning competencies before
you have 'finished'. These challenges will be used as part of your assessment
for this phase.

A developer ready for Phase 3 should be able to deliver any one of these in
under an hour.

## About

While we say these should be completed "solo" you can feel free to ask for
clarification or *help* from your cohort-mates.  However, be quite sure that
you're getting *help* and blindly parroting code into your editor.

As always, consulting API documentation is allowed, but be sure to discern
between "this is core and I should have it memorized" and "ack, what's the name
of that optional flag to that method..."

If you find yourself asking for a lot of help then you've clearly not mastered
the objective.  Go back to your learning and find your gaps and then re-attempt
the challenge.  Were you able to do it faster?  Did new gaps emerge?

## Availability

They will be made available as we cover their content.
