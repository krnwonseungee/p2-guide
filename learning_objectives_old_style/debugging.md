# Debugging

Much of a programmers time is spent trying to bridge the gap between what the
code is currently doing and what it should be doing. Cultivating these skills
pays huge dividends in productivity.

## :+1:
1. I read error messages, and can find where in my code the error was raised
1. I create hypothesis about why the code is broken before I try to fix it.
1. I have a structured approach to proving my hypothesis'
1. I have a structured approach to managing my time when debugging
1. I can identify the boundaries between abstraction layers when debugging
1. I [triangulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation) when debugging
1. I use the chrome console to inspect elements and network traffic.
1. I can use the ruby debugger to inspect program state

## :+1: :+1:
1. I create several hypothesis' about problems before trying to fix it
1. I can leverage the boundaries between abstraction layers when debugging
1. I can use rspec to test my hypothesis
1. I actively look for ways to speed up my feedback loop
1. I context switch between big picture/little picture when debugging
1. When I ask for help I clearly describe the problem I'm trying to solve
1. I can step through code in the ruby debugger
1. My judgement sometimes keeps me from going down rabbit holes

## :+1: :+1: :+1:
1. I create and throw away branches for each hypothesis as I debug
1. My judgement frequently keeps me from going down rabbit holes
1. I quickly find the place in my code where errors are raised
1. I almost solely rely on rspec framework when debugging
