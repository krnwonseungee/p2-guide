# Phase 2

[Overview of the Phase](overview.md) | [Resources](resources.md)

### Week 5:

[Learning Competencies](learning-competencies/week-5-lc.md)

### Notes on Monday and Tuesday

These two days can be very flexible.  The goal of this week is to teach you to
write nice, neat, modular Javascript which, when necessary, uses jQuery to
accomplish things.

While the exact order in which these challenges need to be completed might
vary, we can adjust the schedule as needed.  Since we are doing a "Mega-Day,"
we will be assigning pairs and are rescinding the solo option for Tuesday.

### Notes for the Week:  1/1 Time

On 1/1 days be ready on the machine you wish to demonstrate on at least 5
minutes in advance of your appointment.  Make sure your gems are bundled and
the application (and its tests) can run.  This will ensure the most productive
use of our time together.
