<!-- Potential script for a Banana Slugs intro video mean girls parody  -->

####*Become a testing ninja*

Karen:  It’s like I have ESPN or something!  I can tell when my code is going to raise an error.
Kady: Oh, really!
Karen:  Well, I can tell when it’s *raised* an error.


####*Coaches are awesome helper alumni!*

Coach/Amy Poehler: Now remember, I’m not like, a normal coach, I’m a cool coach.  So, who wants some help with their app?
Kady:  Um, is there Coffeescript in this? *(or some other thing that there’s debate whether we would need to learn about it)*
Coach: Noooo, do you want some?  Because if you’re going to use Coffeescript, I’d rather you do it at dev bootcamp.
Kady: Uh, no, thanks.


####*Javascript can be meaner than mean*

BSlug/Regina George: Can we all just remember, that some of us are just victims of javascript’s crazy parentheses and semicolons?
Teacher: You’re right.  Who here has felt personally victimized by __*(whoever it is)*___’s incomprehensible, non object-oriented javascript?
*(all slugs raise hands)*
*(A teacher or staff member also meekly raises their hand)*
*(BSlug sits down huffily)*


####*Journey through Engineering Empathy*

Alum: I just miss when we were all in phase 0, and everyone got along and we would draw kittens and rainbows and give eachother hugs….*etc.*
BSlug: You aren’t even in our cohort!
Karim: are you even in this cohort?
Alum: No. I just have a lot of feelings.
Karim: Okay, go home.


####*Expose your ignorance*

Gretchen: I knew that no one knew how to use hashes but I asked how to use hashes and my pair just looked at me like I was stupid and I knew that they didn’t know either and… I never told anyone that because… I am a *really good pair.*

####*Learn awesome methods*

Regina: Stop trying to make .fetch happen!  .fetch is never going to happen!

####*You know DRY, but do you know about chafing?*

Janice:  That’s ____*(some banana slug)*_, their code is almost too DRY to function!

####*Stack overflow does not always have the answers*

Kady:  I knew how this would be solved in the wild
*(people shouting)*:  Use semicolons!  No, don’t use them!  Use ember!  No backbone!  You suck at programming!  No you do!  You’re fired!… etc.
Kady: but at DBC, things were different, all of the feedback had to be Actionable, Specific and Kind.

###*Become amazing at github, feel the pain of merge conflicts*

Gretchen: You didn't solve your merge conflict.  You can't sit with us unless you solve your merge conflict.
Regina: Whatever, that's not a real thing.
Gretchen:  You can't sit with us!
