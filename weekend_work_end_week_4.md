Wow!  What a week.  Take a moment on how far you've come in 5 days.  On Monday you were trying to figure out how to make dear ol' grandma shout and this weekend you're building an amazing flash card app and deploying it to the world. Nice (or shall we say Niiiiiiiiiccceeee)

Next week we'll tackle JavaScript.  For the weekend you should:

* Finish your group project

* Finish Portfolio challenges 1-4

* Finish any challenges you didn't get to this week.

* Brush up on your JavaScript:
  * Do or (redo) the JavaScript Labs in Socrates.  Focus on Objects.
  * Read through  [MDN Javascript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide) - in particular: 'Working With Objects'
  * Rewrite these Phase 1 Challenges in JavaScript
    * Roman Numerals
    * Cookies and Ovens

* Take a moment for you. Go outside or sit with a friend. Rejoice in your journey.  Breathe.

Have a great weekend - see you on Monday.
