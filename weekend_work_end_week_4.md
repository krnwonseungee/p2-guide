Hi all,

First, reflect again that on Monday you were learning about TCP/IP and getting
a 1,000 foot view of the internet.  Today you're building a pretty
significant group project.  Wow!

Next week we'll start working with CSS and Javascript in a serious way.  For
your weekend work:

1.  Bush up on your CSS.  Codeacademy has a good reminder course:

2.  Brush up on jQuery.  Codeacademy has a good reminder course:

3.  Deliver your group project

4.  Finish Portfolio challenges 1-4

Remember if you're baffled by something like "Link is not there" or similar,
just send me or Strand an email.

Namaste,

Steven
