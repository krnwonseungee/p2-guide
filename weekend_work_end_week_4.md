Hi all,

First, reflect again that on Monday you were learning about TCP/IP and getting
a 1,000 foot view of the internet.  Today you're building a pretty
significant group project.  Wow!

Next week we'll start working with CSS and JavaScript in a serious way.  For
your weekend work:

* Brush up on jQuery.  Code Academy has a good reminder course:
http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/jquery

* Deliver your group project

* Finish Portfolio challenges 1-4

If you're baffled by something like "Link is not there" or similar,
just send me an email.
