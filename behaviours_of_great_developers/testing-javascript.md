# Testing Javascript

Testing is composed of three main strategies:
1. Unit testing, i.e. testing a single function, object, or object blueprint
1. Integration testing, i.e. testing interactions between objects, i.e.
   javascript and the DOM
1. End to End testing, i.e. testing  your javascript, ruby, and database all at
   once

Unit and Integration testing can be done using the [Jasmine testing
framework](https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine-gem#the-jasmine-gem-); which is
amazing and you should love it dearly. End to End testing is done using
[Capybara and rspec](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara#drivers)

## :+1:
1. I can set up capybara to do full end to end testing for javascript tests
1. I can set up jasmine on a sinatra project
1. I can use jasmine to test javascript that doesn't interact with the DOM or a
   server
1. I can use Capybara to test javascript that interacts with the DOM and server
## :+1: :+1:
1. I can use jasmine to test drive javascript that doesn't interact with the
   DOM or a server
1. I can use jasmine to test javascipt that interacts with the DOM or a server
1. I can use capybara to test drive javascript that interacts with the DOM and
   server
1. I can explain the reasons for using jasmine over capybara and vice versa
## :+1: :+1: :+1:
1. I can use jasmine to  test drive javascript that interacts with the DOM or a server
1. I have a concrete strategy for choosing whether to test something with
   jasmine or capybara.
