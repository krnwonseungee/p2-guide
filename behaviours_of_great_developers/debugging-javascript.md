# Debugging Javascript

Javascript is an interesting language, as it's quite frequently tied to the HTML
of a website. This poses interesting challenges when debugging.

## :+1:
1. I notice when there are errors in the javascript console, and fix those
   before debugging further.
1. I use the console to write small snippets of code to validate my assumptions
1. I can usually find where my code is in a stacktrace, even though it takes
   some time.
1. I use `console.log` to investigate the javascript applications state
1. I am ~50% accurate when guessing if an error is on the server or the client
   side
1. I sometimes reference the Mozilla Developer Network's documentation
1. I'm comfortable dropping into the node console to play with javascript

## :+1: :+1:
1. I use breakpoints and the `debugger` command to investigate bugs in my javascript
1. I write tests to isolate bugs after I've fixed them
1. I'm pretty good at finding my code in javascript stacktraces
1. I can find and use official documentation for the javascript libraries I'm
   using
1. I regularly navigate the official documentation for JavaScript using the
   Mozilla Developers Network

## :+1: :+1: :+1:
1. I use tests to isolate bugs before I've fixed them.
1. I easily navigate the Mozilla Developers Network javascript documentation
1. I am comfortable dropping into the source code of libraries I'm using to
   better understand how they work and how to use them.
