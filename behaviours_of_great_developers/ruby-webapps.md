# Ruby Webapps

Ruby is a [Turing Complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness)
programming language, which means you can do anything computationally possible
with it. You could use it to simulate all of known physics, write artifical
intelligences, or find the the question for the answer for life, the universe,
and everything!

So we'll use it to write webapps.

Below is a set of expected capabilities:

## :+1:
1. I can create a single model CRUD sinatra application and deploy it to Heroku
1. I can draw the [request/response
   cycle](http://devhub.fm/http-requestresponse-basics/), and fill in more
   information when prompted
1. I've handled form input with post routes
1. I've used the route string to define params
1. I've used `session` to store data between requests
1. I've written a useful helper method and used it in both a route and a view

## :+1: :+1:
1. I can explain the different parts of a
   [URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme#Examples)
1. I've handled forms with [nested query
   params](http://codefol.io/posts/9-How-Does-Rack-Parse-Query-Params-With-parse-nested-query)
1. I've configured my app to use different databases in test and development
1. I've used [bcrypt](http://bcrypt-ruby.rubyforge.org/) to encrypt passwords to
   keep them secret even from people who have access to the database.
1. I've used partials and passed them local variables
1. I've written a program that uses
   [Socket](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/socket/rdoc/Socket.html)^
   to communicate between two computers on a local network
1. I use some [restful routes](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html) in my application

## :+1: :+1: :+1:
1. I've deployed a rack compliant app to a hosting service other than heroku
1. I've written a basic [HTTP Server in
ruby](http://oldmoe.blogspot.com/2009/10/ruby-19x-web-servers-booklet.html)
1. All of my applications routes are restful
