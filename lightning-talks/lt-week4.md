Lightning talks are 4~5 minute talks covering a topic or answering a question.
Because you only have 4 minutes, you must prioritize what is the most important
part of a topic.

Everyone will do a lightning talk every week. To volunteer for a talk:

**INSTRUCTIONS: READ CAREFULLY**

1. Check if there are any open pull request to the guide for lightning talks.
Merge these into master(on github).
2. Clone a copy of the this repo to your local machine (if you have previously
cloned then pull the latest version of master).
3. Create a branch named "your-name-volunteers-for--talk-x-on-day-y"
4. Move the talk from the [available talks](#available-talks) to the appropriate
   day.
5. Put your name in front of the talk title.
6. Submit a pull request!  (and get someone else to merge it)
