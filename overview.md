## How This Phase Works
Phase 2 is broken into three weeks with the following themes:

- Testing and Simple Web Applications
- Enhancing Web Applications with JavaScript
- Advanced Web Application Techniques

Each day looks pretty much the same:

- During the day you will pair on a [challenge](#pair-challenges) - with
  Wednesday being Solo Optional days
- Evenings you [optimize your learning](#optimizing-your-learning)
- Fridays and weekends you will work on team [projects](#group-projects),
  continue to [optimize your learning](#optimizing-your-learning), and complete
  your [portfolio projects](#portfolio-projects)


For more information, peruse the [week by week
breakdown](#week-by-week-breakdown), the [day in the life](#a-day-in-the-life),
and [what we work on](#what-do-we-work-on).

## Week By Week Breakdown

### Week 4 : Testing, Simple Web Applications, and Github

In week 4, we introduce Rspec, Sinatra, ActiveRecord, HTML, CSS, and Heroku.
Your primary objective is to feel confident that you can create simple web
applications on a team and on your own, test them, and get them hosted on the
Internet for your friends and loved ones to see. See the [week 4 learning
competencies](learning-competencies/week-4-lc.md) for more details.

### Week 5 : Enhancing Web Applications With JavaScript

In week 5 we add JavaScript,  as a way to enhance your web applications. By the
end of this week you should be capable of creating web applications that
leverage JavaScript to create rich interactions. You will also have a solid
introduction to JavaScript the language. See the [week 5 learning
competencies](learning-competencies/week-5-lc.md) for more details.


### Week 6 : Non-trivial Web Applications
Week 6 ties it all together. Now that you're capable of creating rich web
applications, you must push your abilities to their limit as you discover how to
use background jobs, OAuth, and other APIs.

## A Day In The Life
Most days will look like this:
  - 8:45 - 9:00 Meet with accountability buddies
  - 9:00  EE Training, Daily Retrospective, Presentation, Choose Afternoon Lecture  (mandatory attend)
  - 9:10 - 9:30 daily overview lecture (optional)
  - 9:30 -12:30 work on challenges
  - 12:30 -2:00 Lunch. Optional Yoga Wednesday and Friday
  - 2:00 - 3:00 Afternoon lecture on chosen topic or lightning talks.
  - 3:00 - 5:50 work on challenges
  - 5:50 End of day stand up
  - 6:00 - really late at night ... finish challenges, work on portfolio, optimize your learning.

## What Do We Work On?

### Pair Challenges

Pair challenges are handed out every morning, and are intended to give an
isolated look at at the technical topics we'll be covering.

### Group Projects

Group projects are a great way to bring together everything you've learned from
the week and learn to work on a team.   You will not 'finish' your group
project. There is always more to do, more enhancements to be made, more
features to be added, and more bugs to fix. But you will create something to be
proud of and to learn from.

### Engineering Empathy

A key part of being an exceptional junior developer is sensitivity to your
code, yourself and the people around you. Emotional intelligence training will
help you become more self aware of how you learn and engage with teams.

### Lightning Talks

Lightning talks are 5 minutes where you answer a single question or discuss a
specific topic. By restricting it to 5 minutes, you must choose the most
important things to talk about.  Generally the best lightning talks is 1 idea,
split into 2~3 parts. Any more parts and it gets rushed or too high level.

Lightning talks use a whiteboard only. No projector allowed! Feel free to
practice sketching before giving the talk.

### Optimizing Your Learning

We all learn in different ways. Some of us learn best by:

1. Playing with a technology on our own or with a pair
2. Reviewing videos and tutorials (look in [resources](resources.md) for some suggestions)
3. Setting an absurd goal and working towards it
4. Sleeping

### Portfolio Projects

As a new developer you represent an unknown quantity to prospective employers.
What kind of work do you do?  Do you write sloppy, unfocused commits?  How do
you break a problem apart?  Do you paste dimly-understood nonsense from Stack
Overflow?  The coding world needs the ability to get a read on you.

Since the Renaissance a popular means for learning about the skills of an
artisan has been to consult a portfolio of the arisan's work.  Once you leave
DBC you will have to find pieces that fill out this portfolio on your own, but
in Phase 2 we help get you started by providing **10** challenges that are
designed to give you a means to reflect your personal skill level.

These challenges are also a core part of your assessment of fitness for Phase
3.  They will be made available to you as we cover the relevant content.

### Assessment

Assessment will be based on:

1.  Portfolio challenges
  1.  Were they complete?
  1.  Did the developer complete the work on time?  Early?
  1.  Did the developer take feedback and improve the code?
  1.  Did the code committed reflect mastery and understanding?
  1.  Did the developer find ways to extend the objective to demonstrate
initiative and a zeal for exploration?
1.  Group projects
  1.  Did the developer make "real" contributions to the project
  1.  Did the developer lead in the project
  1.  Did the code committed reflect mastery and understanding?
  1.  Did the developer find ways to extend the objective to demonstrate
initiative and a zeal for exploration?
1.  Lightning talks
  1.  Could the developer speak and share a technical idea effectively?
  1.  Did the developer handle questions well and handle the limits of their
knowledge with grace?
