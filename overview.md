## How This Phase Works
Phase 2 is broken into three weeks with the following themes:

* Testing and Simple Web Applications
* Enhancing Web Applications with JavaScript
* Advanced Web Application Techniques

Each day looks pretty much the same:
* During the day you will pair on a [challenge](#pair-challenges) - with Wednesday being Solo Optional days
* Evenings you [optimize your learning](#optimizing-your-learning)
* Fridays and weekends you will work on team [projects](#group-projects) and continue to [optimize your learning](#optimizing-your-learning)

For more information, peruse the [week by week
breakdown](#week-by-week-breakdown), the [day in the life](#a-day-in-the-life), and [what we work on](#what-do-we-work-on).

## Week By Week Breakdown

### Week 4 : Testing, Simple Web Applications, and Github
In week 4, we introduce Rspec, Sinatra, ActiveRecord, HTML, CSS, and Heroku. Your
primary objective is to feel confident that you can create simple web applications on a team and on your own, test them, and get them hosted on the
Internet for your friends and loved ones to see. See the [week 4 learning competencies](learning-competencies/week-4-lc.md) for more details.

### Week 5 : Enhancing Web Applications With JavaScript
In week 5 we add JavaScript,  as a way to enhance your web applications. By the end of this week you should be capable of creating web applications that leverage JavaScript to create rich interactions. You will also have a solid introduction to JavaScript the language. See the [week 5 learning competencies](learning-competencies/week-5-lc.md) for more details.


### Week 6 : Non-trivial Web Applications
Week 6 ties it all together. Now that you're capable of creating rich web
applications, you must push your abilities to their limit as you discover how to
use background jobs, OAuth, and other APIs.

## A Day In The Life
Most days will look like this:
  * 8:45 - 9:00 Meet with accountability buddies
  * 9:00  EE Training, Daily Retrospective, Presentation, Choose Afternoon Lecture  (mandatory attend)
  * 9:10 - 9:30 daily overview lecture (optional)
  * 9:30 -12:30 work on challenges 
  * 12:30 -2:00 Lunch. Optional Yoga Wednesday and Friday
  * 2:00 - 3:00 Afternoon lecture on chosen topic or lightning talks.  
  * 3:00 - 5:50 work on challenges
  * 5:50 End of day stand up
  * 6:00 - really late at night ... finish challenges, work on portfolio, optimize your learning.

## What Do We Work On?

### Pair Challenges
Pair challenges are handed out every morning, and are intended to give an
isolated look at at the technical topics we'll be covering.

### Group Projects
Group projects are a great way to bring together everything you've learned from the week and learn to work on a team.   You will not 'finish' your
group project. There is always more to do, more enhancements to be made, more
features to be added, and more bugs to fix. But you will create something to be proud of and to learn from. 

### Engineering Empathy
A key part of being an exceptional junior developer is sensitivity to your code,
yourself and the people around you. Emotional intelligence training will help
you become more self aware of how you learn and engage with teams.

### Lightning Talks
Lightning talks are 5 minutes where you answer a single question or discuss a specific topic. By restricting it to 5 minutes, you must choose the most important things to talk about.  Generally the best lightning talks is 1 idea, split into 2~3 parts. Any more parts and it gets rushed or too high level.

Lightning talks use a whiteboard only. No projector allowed! Feel free to practice
sketching before giving the talk.

### Optimizing Your Learning
We all learn in different ways. Some of us learn best by:

1. Playing with a technology on our own or with a pair
2. Reviewing videos and tutorials (look in [resources](resources.md) for some suggestions)
3. Setting an absurd goal and working towards it
4. Sleeping
