## How This Phase Works
Phase 2 is broken into three weeks with the following themes:

* Testing and Simple Web Applications
* Enhancing Web Applications with JavaScript
* Advanced Web Application Techniques

Each day looks pretty much the same:
* During the day you will pair on a [challenge](#pair-challenges) - with Wednesday being Solo Optional days
* Evenings you [optimize your learning](#optimizing-your-learning)
* Fridays and weekends you will work on team [projects](#group-projects) and continue to [optimize your learning](#optimizing-your-learning)

For more information, peruse the [week by week
breakdown](#week-by-week-breakdown), the [day in the
life](#a-day-in-the-life), and [what we work on](#what-do-we-work-on).

## Week By Week Breakdown

### [Week 1](week-1.md) - Testing, Simple Web Applications, and Github
In week 1, we introduce rspec, sinatra, ActiveRecord, and HTML, CSS, and Heroku. Your
primary objective is to feel confident that you can create simple web
applications on a team and on your own, test them, and get them hosted on the
Internet for your friends and loved ones to see.

### [Week 2](week-2.md) - Enhancing Web Applications With JavaScript
In week 2 we add JavaScript,  as a way to
enhance your web applications. By the end of this week you should be capable of
creating web applications that leverage JavaScript to create rich interactions. You will also have a solid introduction to JavaScript the language.

### [Week 3](week-3.md) - Non-trivial Web Applications
Week 3 ties it all together. Now that you're capable of creating rich web
applications, you must push your abilities to their limit as you discover how to
use background jobs, OAuth, and other APIs.

## A Day In The Life

### Mornings
On weekdays we meet in the meadow for [emotional intellienge
training](#emotional-intelligence) at 9AM.

After search inside yourself, boots:

1. Work through the [pair challenge](#pair-challenges).
2. Prepare their afternoon [lightning talk](#lightning-talks).

Mornings will often include an optional lecture on a specific topic.

### Afternoons
Monday - Friday at 2 PM we meet in the cave for [lightning talks](#lightning-talks) or teacher lead lectures on an topic of your choice.


### Evenings
We have sometimes end the day with a 5:30 standup. Each boot answers the following questions:

1. What did you wind up doing yesterday evening?
2. What are you planning to do this evening?
3. What "Aha!" moments did you have in the last 24 hours?

After standup, you should finish your pair work for the day and begin
[optimizing your learning.](#optimizing-your-learning).

## What Do We Work On?

### Pair Challenges
Pair challenges are handed out every morning, and are intended to give an
isolated look at at the technical topics we'll be covering.

### Group Projects
Group projects are a great way to bring together everything you've learned from the week and learn to work on a team.   You will not 'finish' your
group project. There is always more to do, more enhancements to be made, more
features to be added, and more bugs to fix. But you will create something to be proud of and to learn from. 


### Emotional Intelligence
A key part of being an exceptional junior developer is sensitivity to your code,
yourself and the people around you. Emotional intelligence training will help
you become more self aware of how you learn and engage with teams.

### Lightning Talks
Lightning talks are 5 minutes where you answer a single question or discuss a
specific topic. By restricting it to 5 minutes, you must choose the most
important things to talk about.  Generally the best lightning talks is 1 idea,
split into 2~3 parts. Any more parts and it gets rushed or too high level.

Lightning talks use a whiteboard. No projector allowed! Feel free to practice
sketching before giving the talk.

### Optimizing Your Learning
We all learn in different ways. Some of us learn best by:

1. Playing with a technology on their own or with a pair
2. Reviewing videos and tutorials
3. Setting an absurd goal and working towards it
4. Sleeping

In the week overview, We've aggregated some of the best tutorials we (and
previous boots) could find, collected a few useful and interesting technologies,
and even given some cahrazy ideas you may want to try implementing on your own
or as a group. Of course, feel free to pursue your own!
